                <h3>About FAQ</h3>
                <p>An FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page is a dedicated section on a website that provides answers to common questions users may have. It serves as a resource to address inquiries and concerns, helping users find information quickly without the need to contact customer support.

                In the context of whitewater rafting, an FAQ page could cover a range of topics, such as safety measures, trip details, equipment, booking procedures, and any other queries potential participants might have. It's a valuable tool for enhancing user experience, building trust, and streamlining the information-seeking process. When designing an FAQ page, clarity, organization, and easy navigation are key to ensuring users can easily find the answers they are looking for.
